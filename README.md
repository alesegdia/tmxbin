# TMXBin

The purpose of this project is to provide tools to transform .tmx maps and .tsx tilesets from tiled
to a binary format .tmb and .tsb respectively, hence reducing the need of an XML parser and drastically
reducing the size of the file, as well as providing a thin layer to read binary files with this format
in your application.

## To-Do
